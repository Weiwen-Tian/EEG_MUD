# An electroencephalographic signature predicts craving for methamphetamine
Scripts for EEG signature in Methamphetamine use disorder

## Overview
This repository contains a customized MATLAB code written along with the manuscript from Tian et al. ["An electroencephalographic signature predicts craving for methamphetamine"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2023.101347). As this is adapted to a specific type of analysis, there are necessarily functions and parts of the codes that might not generalize so well to your data.
